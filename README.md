# speakers-app

The Project is built with MEAN.JS (version:  0.42), which  is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and AngularJS based applications.
By this app, you can sign up, log in, create speakers. It also allows you to view, edit, and delete speakers.

How to use the app?
1) Clone the app into your local drive
2) Run npm install and bower install to install Node.js dependencies 
3) Run npm start or node server to start the app. Before this, you need to start Mongodb first.
The application runs on port 3000, so in your browser just go to http://localhost:3000.
